## Exercise 3: Referencing Data in Formulas (relative vs absolute) & Formula Errors
In this exercise, you will learn how to reference data in formulas; specifically differentiating between relative and absolute references, and you will also learn about error handling in formulas.

- In cells A31-A40, type 1-10. Select row 31 to 40. On the Home tab, click the Number Format drop-down list, and select General.
  
- Relative References : In cell B33, type =A31+A32 and press Enter. Select the fill handle on cell B33 and drag to B40 to copy the formula. Here, both first and second cell reference will move 1 cell down. For example, on cell B34 formula will be changed to =A32+A33, on cell B35 formula will be changed to =A33+A34 and so on.
- Absolute References : In cell C33, type =$A$31+$A$32 and press Enter. Select the fill handle on cell C33 and drag to C40 to copy the formula. Here, both first and second cell references will not change. For example, on cell C34 formula will remain =$A$31+$A$32, on cell C35 formula will remain =$A$31+$A$32 and so on.
- Mixed References : In cell D33, type =$A$31+$A32 and press Enter. Select the fill handle on cell D33 and drag to D40 to copy the formula. Here, first cell reference will stay the same, but the second reference will change. For example, on cell D34 formula will be changed to =$A$31+$A33, on cell D35 formula will be changed to =$A$31+$A34 and so on.

- In cell B31, type =A16+A17. Now this will lead to a formula error #VALUE! since cells A16 and A17 do not contain any number.
- Click the question mark icon in the error message box. This will open the Help for this topic. Read through this help file for more information about #VALUE! errors in formulas.
